# Final Report (2–3 pages)

## 1) Architecture Overview
- Briefly describe Git+DVC, pipeline stages, Docker, CI/CD, SageMaker.
- Include diagram from `docs/architecture.mmd` (render in your doc tool).

## 2) Key Design Decisions
- Why DVC (vs. only Git LFS), why FastAPI, why RandomForest baseline.
- Feature preprocessing choice (OHE) and params.

## 3) Baseline Results
- Paste metrics from `artifacts/metrics.json` and `artifacts/eval_report.json`.
- Note class balance and any mitigation (threshold tuning, class_weight, etc.).

## 4) Deployment Summary
- ECR, model registration, endpoint config, and update policy.
- Sample inference latency measured locally and on SageMaker.

## 5) Monitoring & Drift
- What you’re tracking (latency, error rate, input drift via categorical frequency deltas).
- Alert thresholds and tooling (CloudWatch or Prometheus/Grafana).

## 6) Lessons Learned
- Repro pitfalls, CI speed-ups (SMALL_RUN), infra gotchas.
